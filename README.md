# User's Guide

## Introduction
CleanCalendar is a calendar that will organize your tasks clearer and in a managing order. The calendar allows users to create, edit and delete events with descriptions. The calendar has clear day and week view for users to check events.

It was developed by a team of four students studying at the University of Oregon as part of their Spring Term CIS 422 Software Methodology class assignments. The team aimed to create an application that is robust and intuitive to use.

## System Requirements
CleanCalendar was mostly developed in the Windows environment, so the software is optimized under the Windows environment.
The software was not tested extensively in other mainstream operating systems, so do expect some imperfections in the program if you must use the software in a non-Windows environment.
